# Text Classification with Naive Bayes

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a text classification problem using the 20 Newsgroups dataset. The objective is to classify text data into specific categories by training a Naive Bayes classifier on the dataset. The dataset comprises newsgroup posts across various topics, and we focus on four categories:

- rec.autos

- sci.med

- comp.graphics

- talk.politics.misc

The project pipeline involves data preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, training a classifier, and evaluating the model's performance.

## Motivation

This project was initiated as part of my journey into learning Natural Language Processing (NLP). Text classification is one of the foundational tasks in NLP, and understanding it helps build skills in data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation. By working with real-world datasets like the 20 Newsgroups, I aim to gain hands-on experience with practical challenges and develop a strong foundation for more advanced NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and text generation.

## Used Technologies

The following technologies and libraries are used in this project:

- **Python**: Programming language for implementing the solution.

- **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing, vectorization, and building the Naive Bayes classifier.

- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.

## Dataset Description

The 20 Newsgroups dataset is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned into 20 different categories. [Here](https://scikit-learn.org/0.19/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html) is the data source.

## Future Work

Experiment with additional categories to broaden the classification scope.

Try advanced vectorization techniques like **Word2Vec or BERT embeddings**.

Optimize model parameters for better accuracy.
