# Text Classification with Naive Bayes

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a text classification problem using the 20 Newsgroups dataset. The objective is to classify text data into specific categories by training a Naive Bayes classifier on the dataset. The dataset comprises newsgroup posts across various topics, and we focus on four categories:

- rec.autos

- sci.med

- comp.graphics

- talk.politics.misc

The project pipeline involves data preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, training a classifier, and evaluating the model's performance.
